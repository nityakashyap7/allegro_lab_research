# Relative Memorization Experiments – Summer 2025

 👩‍🔬 Mentorship
	•	PhD Mentor: Johnny Wei
	•	PI: Prof. Robin Jia
	•	Lab: [AI, Language, Learning, Generalization, and Robustness (ALLeGRo) Lab](https://allegro-lab.github.io/)
 

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository documents my contributions to my mentor's PhD thesis project on relative memorization at the ALLeGRo Lab. The lab has trained a suite of 8 LLMs called the Hubble Models. My primary responsibilities include:
	•	Inference & Validation: Running inference on the Hubble models to verify output correctness and analyze patterns of memorization.
	•	Small Model Experiments: Training smaller-scale models on subsets of the Hubble dataset to determine whether they replicate the same memorization trends.

### Why This Matters
If memorization trends in smaller models mirror those in large-scale models, it suggests smaller models can act as cost-effective proxies for studying memorization. This would significantly lower the computational and financial barriers for AI companies to evaluate and mitigate memorization risks, which are critical for robustness, privacy, and legal compliance.


## 🧠 Research Objectives
- Quantify and visualize memorization patterns in Hubble Models by running inference
- Train a suite of smaller models on subsets of Hubble model training data
- Evaluate whether memorization patterns in smaller models align with those in the Hubble models
